4. Integration with Shadcn Components: Where applicable, integrate Shadcn pre-made components 
to expedite development and maintain visual consistency. Ensure seamless integration without 
compromising performance. 5. Testing: Write comprehensive unit tests using Jest to ensure 
functionality. Develop E2E tests with Playwright to validate integration and user 
interactions. 6. Documentation: Create MDX documentation, including usage examples, props, 
and methods. Provide clear instructions for installation and integration into larger projects. 
7. Accessibility: Follow best practices for accessibility, ensuring the component is usable 
by all users, including those with disabilities. 8. Version Control: Ensure all code is 
well-documented and version-controlled for future updates and maintenance.`;
